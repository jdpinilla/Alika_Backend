Answer on: HoW mUcH LevErAgE, sIr?

Leverage only effects your liquidation point. When this gets hit you get margin called and you'll pay for @cz_binance breakfast, lunch and dinner. We don't want that.

That's why we use a StopLoss in combination with the right position size. So when the trade moves against us we only loose 1% of our capital and not our whole initial margin. 

In a LONG the SL should always be above the liquidation point. 
In a SHORT your SL should always be below the liquidation point. 

When we increase our Leverage the liquidation price moves towards our entry point. That means our SL has to be smaller since price should always meet the SL before it has the chance to meet the liquidation price.

Leverage does not increase your profits, it decreases your initial margin so you can "take more" trades

Isolated Margin(Binance): You can only lose your initial margin when the liquidation point gets hit
Cross Margin(Binance): You lose your whole future account when the liquidation point gets hit

SO USE ISOLATED MARGIN WHEN YOU ARE A BEGINNER

POSITION SIZE GUIDE

In this example, you are entering a LONG position of BTC...
:point_right: Entry Price: $38000
:point_right: SL (stop loss): $37900

Trading Account Balance: $2000
Risk %: 1% (or 0.01)

To calculate your Risk Amount for the trade...

$2000 (acc balance) x 1% (risk %) = $20

:point_right: $20 is your Risk Amount for the trade.
That's the amount you lose if your SL gets hit.

 - -
Correct Position Size: Risk Amount/(Entry-SL)

First, minus the stop loss from the entry price:
38000 - 37900 = 100

Now, divide the Risk Amount by the (Entry - SL)...
20 / 100 = 0.2

0.2 BTC is the correct position size for this trade.
